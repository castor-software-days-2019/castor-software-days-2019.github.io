#### Abstract

The design of security protocols is typically approached as an art,
rather than a science, and often with disastrous consequences. But
this need not be so!  I have been working for ca. 20 years on
foundations, methods, and tools, both for developing protocols that
are correct by construction and for the post-hoc verification of
existing designs.  In this talk I will introduce my work in this area
and describe my experience analyzing, improving, and contributing to
different industry standards, both existing and upcoming.
