#### Abstract

Software built for small businesses often doesnâ€™t benefit from the same resources that big tech companies have at their disposal. How can devOps and automation prevent it from becoming the legacy software that everybody hates?

#### Bio

Since having graduated from KTH in 2018, Simone has been working as a software engineer mainly focusing on devOps, automation and data analysis. He continues to be involved in development of technical education at KTH.
